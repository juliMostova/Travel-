And in general, 85% of the stateâ€™s territory is permafrost. Mosses and lichens can lie on the surface, dwarf willows bend in the wind and writhe 
in the embrace of the cold, black spruce trees stick out at random, as if dancing on drunken legs, but dig a little and you will find the ground frozen for many meters. We can draw meridians on the map and argue until we are hoarse whether this is the Middle East of America, or the edge where its West ends. You canâ€™t argue about the North of America: Alaska is the North.
Alaska is the North, and the North is harsh. On January 23, 1971, Prospect 
Creek recorded a temperature of -62.2â„ƒ`,

    green forests and palm-fringed beaches. Bali is Indonesia's most important tourist 
    destination and, as a result, suffers from commercialization
